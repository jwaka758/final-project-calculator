- This is a simple calculator that performs basic mathematical operations like "addition", "substraction", "multiplication"
  and "division". When the program is run, a pop-up screen appears showing a calculator that allow users to perform basic mathematical operations.

- The calculator has 3 empty entry boxes. The first 2 boxes allow the user to enter numerical values in order 
  to perform any necessary mathematical operation. For example, the user can enter any real number regardless of its sign
  (1, 2, -5, 0.55, 10000). The two entry boxes are separated by a mathematical operation symbol which changes depending 
 on the operation selected by the user. 

- The third text box on the far right side, labeled "Answer", gives the answer to any calculation whenever the 
  "equal" button is pushed. If a non real number or an invalid character like &8fgvf or ^g## is entered, the box will 
  display "NaN" meaning the result to the calculation is not a real number.

- The calculator has a drop down menu that allows the user to choose between mathematical operations. The different 
 mathematical operations available are: "Add, Substract, Divide and Multiply"

- Lastly, the calculator has an "equal" button on the bottom right corner that allows the user to display the final answer
  to any calculation performed.

Example of operation to perform using the calculator: 5 + 8 = 13. HAVE FUN!!!

- This is a simple calculator that performs basic mathematical operations like "addidng", "substracting", "multiplying"
  and "dividing". When the program is run, a pop-up screen appears showing a calculator that allow users to perform basic mathematical operations.

- The calculator has 3 empty panels(empty rectangles). The first 2 panels allow the user to enter numerical values in order 
  to perform the necessary mathematical operation. For example, the user can enter any real number regardless of its sign
  (1, 2, -5, 0.55, 10000). The two panels are separated by a mathematical operation symbol. 

- The third empty panel on the far right side, labeled "Answer", gives the answer to the mathematical operation once the 
  "equal" button is pressed. If an non real number or an invalid character like &8fgvf or ^g## is entered, the panel will 
  display "NaN" meaning the result to the mathematical operation is not a real number.

- The calculator has a drop down menu that allows the user to choose between mathematical operations. The different 
 mathematical operations available are: "Add, Substract, Divide and Multiply"

- Lastly, the calculator has an "equal button" on the bottom right corner that allows the user to display the final answer
  to the mathematical operation they performed.

Example of operation to perform using the calculator: 5 + 8 = 13. HAVE FUN!!!
